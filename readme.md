exploit_dir=$(mktemp -d): Creates a temporary directory using the mktemp -d command and stores its path in the exploit_dir variable. The temporary directory is needed to securely store the exploit files.

exploit_file="${exploit_dir}/root.pm": Sets the exploit_file variable to the path of the Perl module file within the temporary directory.

cat > "${exploit_file}" << EOF: Starts creating the Perl module file (root.pm) and redirects the subsequent lines until EOF into the file.

Package and module content: The code between << EOF and EOF represents the Perl module (root.pm) that will be created. It defines a package named root and contains minimal code to execute the /bin/sh shell.

export PERL5LIB="${exploit_dir}": Sets the PERL5LIB environment variable to the path of the temporary directory. This variable specifies the directory where Perl should search for modules.

export PERL5OPT="-Mroot": Sets the PERL5OPT environment variable to -Mroot, instructing Perl to load the root module we created earlier.

/usr/exim/bin/exim -ps: Executes the Exim binary located at /usr/exim/bin/exim with the -ps argument. This starts Exim with the manipulated Perl environment, causing it to load the root module. As a result, the /bin/sh shell is executed.

rm -rf "${exploit_dir}": Removes the temporary directory and its contents using the rm -rf command. This cleanup step ensures that no traces of the exploit files remain.
